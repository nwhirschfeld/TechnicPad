## Electronics
For now the electronics are handwired around an _Pro Micro_ Board.
Only Boards with a USB-C port __on__ the PCB are supported for now.

>  I may add a version with a custom PCB later if people are interested in the project.

## Case

3D print the case with a high resolution to get a nice look & feel.
It may help to drill out the holes with a 4.8mm drill to make it fit perfectly.
